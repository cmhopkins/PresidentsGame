# PresidentsGame
Simple Javascript game asking players to type in the name of the U.S. president shown in the picture. The game is hosted on [Replit](https://presidentsgame.carolinehopkin1.repl.co/). 

# How to Play
The game will display a picture of each U.S. president in random order. To play, type the name of the president into the input box. The names are case and grammar sensitive. For example, "Harry S. Truman" is accepted but "Harry S Truman" is not accepted. If the president is known by a popular nickname, or by their initials, that will be accepted too (for example, "JFK").
